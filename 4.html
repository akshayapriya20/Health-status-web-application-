<head><h2><b>FOOD TO BE TAKEN FOR UNDERWEIGHT</b></h2></head>
<h2>Preliminary steps</h2>
<body>
<p>Firstly, eliminate all the causes of underweight. Make sure that you do not suffer from underlying illnesses that cause weight loss or hamper weight gain and that other important factors such as medications, depression, or anxiety are not preventing you from gaining weight.If you have a clean bill of physical and mental health, the solution to underweight is to ingest more energy on a daily basis than you use up for physiological processes and physical activity.</p>
<ul><b>Foods that should be included every day:</b>
<li>Full-cream milk: 750 - 1000 ml (3 to 4 cups)</li>
<li>Meat, fish, eggs and other protein foods: 3-5 servings (90 to 150 g)</li>
<li>Bread and cereals: 8-12 servings (e.g. up to 6 cups of starch a day)</li>

<ol>Although being lean can often be healthy, being underweight can be a concern if it's the result of poor nutrition or if you are pregnant or have other health concerns. So, if you're underweight, see your doctor or dietician for an evaluation. Together, you can plan how to meet your goal weight. Here are some healthy ways to gain weight when you're underweight:

<li><b> Eat more frequently.</b>
When you're underweight, you may feel full faster. Eat five to six smaller meals during the day rather than two or three large meals.</li>
<li><b> Choose nutrient-rich foods.</b>
As part of an overall healthy diet, choose whole-grain breads, pastas and cereals; fruits and vegetables; dairy products; lean protein sources; and nuts and seeds.</li>
Try smoothies and shakes.
Don't fill up on diet soda, coffee and other drinks with few calories and little nutritional value. Instead, drink smoothies or healthy shakes made with milk and fresh or frozen fruit, and sprinkle in some ground flaxseed. In some cases, a liquid meal replacement may be recommended.</li>
<li><b> Watch when you drink.</b>
Some people find that drinking fluids before meals blunts their appetite. In that case, it may be better to sip higher calorie beverages along with a meal or snack. For others, drinking 30 minutes after a meal, not with it, may work.</li>
<li><b>Make every bite count.</b>
Snack on nuts, peanut butter, cheese, dried fruits and avocados. Have a bedtime snack, such as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or a wrap sandwich with avocado, sliced vegetables, and lean meat or cheese.</li>
<li><b>Top it off.</b>
Add extras to your dishes for more calories — such as cheese in casseroles and scrambled eggs, and fat-free dried milk in soups and stews.
<li><b>Have an occasional treat.</b>
Even when you're underweight, be mindful of excess sugar and fat. An occasional slice of pie with ice cream is OK. But most treats should be healthy and provide nutrients in addition to calories. Bran muffins, yogurt and granola bars are good choices.</li>
<li><b>Exercise.</b>
Exercise, especially strength training, can help you gain weight by building up your muscles. Exercise may also stimulate your appetite.

<p><b>Tips to Make Your ,Diet Healthier and Balanced</b></p>
<p>A healthy diet has been scientifically proven to provide numerous health benefits, such as reducing your risk of several chronic diseases and keeping your body healthy. However, making major changes to your diet can sometimes seem very overwhelming. Instead of making big changes, it may be better to start with a few smaller ones. This article discusses 25 small changes that can make a regular diet a little bit healthier.</p><br>
<img src=".\pic4.jpg"width="800" height="400">
<p><b>1. Slow Down</b> <br>
The pace at which you eat influences how much you eat, as well as how likely you are to gain weight. In fact, studies comparing different eating speeds show that fast eaters are up to 115% more likely to be obese than slow eaters . Your appetite, how much you eat and how full you get is all controlled by hormones. These hormones signal your brain whether you’re hungry or full. However, it takes about 20 minutes for your brain to receive these messages, so eating more slowly would give your brain the time it needs to perceive that you are full. Studies have confirmed this, showing that eating slowly may reduce the number of calories you consume at meals and help you lose weight. Eating slowly is also linked to more thorough chewing, which has also been linked to better weight maintenance . Therefore, simply by eating slower and chewing more often, you can reduce your risk of eating too much and gaining excess weight<br>
<b>2. Choose Whole-Grain Bread — Not Refined</b>
You can easily make your diet a bit healthier by choosing whole grain bread in place of traditional refined-grain bread. As opposed to refined grains, which have been linked to many health issues, whole grains have been linked to a variety of health benefits, including a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer . They are also a good source of fiber, B vitamins and several minerals, such as zinc, iron, magnesium and manganese. There are many varieties of whole-grain bread available, and many of them even taste better than refined bread. Just make sure to read the label to ensure that your bread is made with whole grains only, not a mixture of whole and refined grains.<br></p>
<p><b>3. Add Greek Yogurt to Your Diet</b> 
 <br>Greek yogurt (or Greek-style yogurt) is thicker and creamier than regular yogurt. It has been strained to remove its excess whey, which is the watery part of milk. The end result is a yogurt that is higher in fat and protein than regular yogurt. In fact, it contains up to three times the amount of protein found in the same amount of regular yogurt, or up to 9 grams per 100 grams. Eating a good source of protein helps you feel fuller for longer, helping you manage your appetite and eat fewer calories overall <br>

<b>4. Don’t Shop Without a List</b>
There are two important strategies to employ when you go grocery shopping: make your shopping list ahead of time and don’t go to the store hungry. Not knowing exactly what you need makes room for impulse buying, while hunger can further exacerbate your impulses. To make sure you don’t give in to your impulses, plan ahead and write down what you need beforehand. By doing this and sticking to your list, you will not only buy healthier items but also save money and have healthier foods around the house. <br>
<b>5. Eat Eggs, Preferably for Breakfast</b>
Eggs are incredibly healthy, especially if you eat them in the morning. They are rich in high-quality protein and many essential nutrients that people often don’t get enough of, such as choline. When looking at studies comparing various types of calorie-matched breakfasts, eggs come out on top. Eating eggs in the morning increases feelings of fullness. This has been shown to cause people to consume fewer calories over the next 36 hours, which can be quite helpful for weight loss .  <br>
<b>6. Increase Your Protein Intake</b>
Protein is often referred to as the king of nutrients, and it does seem to have some superpowers. Due to its ability to affect your hunger and satiety hormones, it’s the most filling of the macronutrients . One study showed that simply increasing protein intake from 15% to 30% of calories made people eat 441 fewer calories per day, without actively restricting their intake. What’s more, protein helps you retain muscle mass, which determines the rate of your metabolism. A high protein intake may increase the number of calories you burn by 80–100 per day . This is especially important for preventing the loss of muscle mass that can occur during weight loss and as you age .  <br>
<b>7. Drink Enough Water</b>
Drinking enough water is important for your health. Many studies have shown that drinking water may benefit weight loss, weight maintenance and even slightly increase the number of calories you burn daily . Studies also show that drinking water before meals can reduce appetite and calorie intake during the subsequent meal in middle-aged and older adults . That said, the most important thing is to drink water instead of other beverages. This may drastically reduce your sugar and calorie intake . People who drink mostly water have been shown to consume 200 fewer calories per day, on average, than those who drink other beverages .</p> <br>
